# üí´ About Me:
### Hello, World! I'm Martin, aka Mr Galt üëã
Welcome to my corner of GitHub, a digital scrapbook of my coding journey! I'm an active person with a background in security and diplomatic affairs, who had a eureka moment in his late 30s and decided to dive into the fascinating world of coding.

I'm currently navigating the intense learning curve of the 42 Cursus in Abu Dhabi. After years spent in security and diplomacy, you might wonder why I made such a career shift. It's simple: I believe that it's never too late to embrace change and learn new things. The future is digital, and I want to be a part of shaping it.

What I've realized is that coding isn't that different from my previous experiences - it requires problem-solving skills, determination, and a pinch of creativity, all of which I had plenty of practice with in my former careers.

### My Coding Journey üöÄ
Here, you'll find repositories documenting my progress through the 42 world as a student, with code, reflections, and resources that have helped me along the way.

Whether you're a fellow code enthusiast, a curious onlooker, or a seasoned tech guru, I invite you to explore my projects, engage with my code, and join me on this exhilarating adventure!

### Outside Coding ‚õ∞Ô∏è
When I'm not lost in the Matrix, I enjoy a wide range of activities. From hiking and crossfit to reading and gaming, I love keeping myself engaged and challenged. If you ever want to discuss the latest business idea or debate the merits of different gaming consoles, I'm your man!<br>

### Let's Connect üåê
I'm always up for a chat, collaboration, or just meeting new people. Feel free to connect with me here on Git.
Remember, it's never too late to change your stars, to dive into new waters, and to start a new chapter. Happy exploring, and keep coding!
